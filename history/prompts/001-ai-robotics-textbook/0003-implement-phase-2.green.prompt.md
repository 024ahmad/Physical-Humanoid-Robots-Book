## Prompt

phase-2

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed Phase 2 implementation for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook project. Completed all Module 1 content (Weeks 1-5) with 20/20 tasks completed. Created comprehensive content for all 5 weeks including: Week 1 (Foundations of Physical AI - 970 words), Week 2 (Sensing the World - 840 words), Week 3 (Motor Control & Action - 949 words), Week 4 (Perception Pipeline - 844 words), and Week 5 (Digital Twin Concepts - 728 words). Created 5 conceptual examples: sensor simulation, sensor loop, balance logic, perception simulation, and digital twin simulation. Created 3 diagrams: sensor-brain-action flow, perception stages, and real world-digital world loop. Total word count for Module 1: 4,654 words (within 4,000-5,000 range). All content meets requirements and tasks are marked as completed in the tasks file.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Module 1 content completed successfully with all required components
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for this implementation phase
- 📁 Files: Created 11 content files, 3 diagram files, and updated tasks file
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to proceed with Phase 3 implementation (Module 2 content)
- 🧠 Reflection: Module 1 provides solid foundation for Physical AI concepts with balanced theoretical and practical content

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation of Phase 3 tasks (Module 2 content)
