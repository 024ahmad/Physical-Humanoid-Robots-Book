## Dependencies

1. **Phase 1** must be completed before starting Module content
2. Each Module can be developed in parallel after Phase 1 completion
3. Quality checks (Phase 6) require all content to be complete
4. Build & Deploy (Phase 7) requires all content and validation to pass
5. Final Submission (Phase 8) requires successful deployment

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

- Module 1, 2, 3, and 4 content can be developed in parallel after Phase 1
- Individual weeks within each module can be developed in parallel by different team members
- Diagram creation can happen in parallel with content writing
- Example creation can happen in parallel with content writing
- Quality checks can be performed incrementally as content is completed

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope**: Complete Module 1 (Weeks 1-5) with all associated diagrams and examples to demonstrate the textbook format and structure.

**Incremental Delivery**: Complete each module sequentially, ensuring proper validation before moving to the next module.

**Validation Points**:
- After each week: Validate word count and content quality
- After each module: Validate diagrams, examples, and total word count
- After all modules: Run full quality checks and accessibility validation
- Before deployment: Final validation of all requirements
